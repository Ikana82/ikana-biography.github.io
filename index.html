                <div class="bio-col">
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh was a painter from the Netherlands. He was born in 1853 in Zundert. At first, he worked in an art shop and tried being a preacher. Then, he chose to become a painter and mostly taught himself.</p><br>
                    <p>At first, he painted farmers and workers, like in The Potato Eaters. After moving to Paris in 1886, he met other artists and started using brighter colors. His most active time was in Arles, where he made Sunflowers and The Bedroom. He later had mental health issues and stayed in a hospital, where he painted The Starry Night. He died in 1890.</p><br>

                <div class="bio-col">
                    <p>Van Gogh was deeply interested in nature, people, and spirituality, believing that art should express emotion and moral depth. He used color symbolically, with yellow often representing warmth and divinity. Though largely unrecognized during his life, his works and letters to his brother Theo have since become invaluable, making him one of the most influential figures in modern art history.</p><br>

                <p class="profesi-right">Vincent van Gogh was a famous painter whose artworks still inspire people today. Some of his paintings are very well-known because of their strong feelings, special style, and memorable look.</p>

                    <div class="iconic-text">
                        <p>Vincent van Gogh created many iconic paintings, and four of the most famous are The Starry Night (1889), Sunflowers (1888), Irises (1889), and The Night Café (1888). The Starry Night shows a swirling night sky full of stars and a bright moon, painted while Van Gogh was in a mental hospital. Sunflowers is a bright and warm painting of yellow flowers in a vase, made to welcome his friend Paul Gauguin.</p><br>
                        <p>Irises was painted during his stay in the hospital and shows peaceful blue flowers with strong contrast. The Night Café uses bold red and green colors to express a feeling of loneliness and discomfort in a small café. These works show Van Gogh’s emotions, his love of nature, and his unique artistic style.</p>

Before diving into each chapter of his story, discover the struggles, the brotherly bond, and the artistic brilliance that shaped one of history’s most iconic painters. This page offers an intimate glimpse into Van Gogh’s life: from his humble beginnings and personal demons to the lasting fame he never lived to witness.</p>

                    <div class="iconic-text">
                        <p>It wasn’t until his late twenties that Van Gogh turned seriously to painting. With the support of his younger brother Theo, who believed in his talent and financed much of his work, Vincent began to develop his artistic skills largely on his own, influenced by realism and later by impressionism and Japanese prints. His early works were dark and somber, focusing on the lives of peasants, such as The Potato Eaters (1885).</p><br>
                        <p>Theo van Gogh was more than a brother; he was Vincent’s closest confidant and emotional anchor. Their correspondence, consisting of hundreds of letters, provides profound insight into Vincent’s inner world — his thoughts on art, philosophy, suffering, and his mental health. Theo constantly encouraged Vincent to continue painting and believed his brother's talent would one day be recognized.</p>

                        <p>From 1886 to 1888, Vincent lived in Paris and was exposed to avant-garde artists like Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, and Seurat. His style evolved rapidly — brighter colors, dynamic brushwork, and emotional intensity began to characterize his paintings. He later moved to Arles in southern France, seeking peace and inspiration. It was here that he painted some of his most iconic works, including Sunflowers, The Bedroom, and Café Terrace at Night.</p><br>
                        <p>However, this period also marked the escalation of his mental health issues. He suffered from anxiety, psychotic episodes, and delusions. His infamous breakdown in 1888 led him to mutilate his left ear, and he voluntarily admitted himself to a psychiatric asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Despite — or perhaps because of — his fragile state, Van Gogh remained extremely productive, creating over 150 paintings during his time in the asylum, including The Starry Night.</p>

                        <p>In 1890, Van Gogh moved to Auvers-sur-Oise under the care of Dr. Paul Gachet, who encouraged him to paint and believed in art’s therapeutic power. Though his mental state seemed to improve, he continued to experience bouts of despair.</p><br>
                        <p>On July 27, 1890, at the age of 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest in a wheat field. He died two days later, with Theo at his side. At the time of his death, he was virtually unknown, had sold very few paintings, and struggled with feelings of failure.</p>
